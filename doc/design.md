user must focus all of their related party members. Focused actors will bind to bumpers + dpads. Allowing up to 12. <-- Unsure how to set/clear that as of now. Probably a sub menu off the selet button.

Campaign Analyzer: <-- Before loading, a campaign Analyzer should lint and provide feedback in a log file.
